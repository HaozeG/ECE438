## Problems Encountered

### To create a large file for test
```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=largefile bs=1G count=1
```
this creates a file named largefile with size 1G filled with zeros.

### Dealing with Header and Remaining information
It is possible that you only receive a header with one `recv()`. Need to check for the return value of `recv()` to extract header.

### Parse header/input arguments
`strstr(*ptr, *delim)` return a pointer to the location of `*delim`.

`strtok(*ptr, *delim)` replace the location of the first `*delim` encountered with NULL. 
Use `*ptr=NULL` to deal with the part of string after the first `*delim`.

### Read continuously from file
`fgets()` returns a pointer to a new-line terminated string. Not compatible with `strlen()`.

`fread()` return number of bytes read. Can be used in `send()` to specify the part of data in buffer that is useful.

`strlen()` is problematic. Would bring incorrect count.
